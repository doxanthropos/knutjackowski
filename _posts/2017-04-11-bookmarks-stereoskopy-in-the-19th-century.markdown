  Some bookmarks from a course on the history of stereoskopy
---

The great course [Stereoscopy: An Introduction to Victorian Stereo Photography](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/stereoscopy) from the University of Edinburgh and the National Museums Scotland contained links and mentions of many sources that I would like to come back to. So I am leaving them here.


## Artists and Inventors

* [Charles Wheatstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone): Inventor of the stereoskope, first used with drawings, before the invention of photography.
* [David Brewster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brewster): Inventor of the [Kaleidoskope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope) and of a stereoskopic viewer based on lenses, instead of mirrors.
* [Jules Dubosc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Duboscq): Built David Brewsters Lentiscope and produced images for it. For example from the great exibition in London 1851.
* [Francis Frith](http://www.francisfrith.com/pages/frith-about): A merchant turned photographer, who made very successfull stereoskopic photographs from around the world, especially egypt and middle east.
* [Brian May](http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssb.html): Mostly known for being the guitarist of The Queen, he also is, among other things, an author of books on the topic of stereoskopy and researcher on that topic.
