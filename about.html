	  	<p>Hello! I'm a web developer (in training) and currently in search of a new position to use my skills.</p>
	  	<p>These skills are: HTML/CSS (of course), JavaScript, jQuery and some Python.</p>
		 <p>Aside from coding I have experience in teaching, especially technical topics to non-technical people and in e-learning.</p>
