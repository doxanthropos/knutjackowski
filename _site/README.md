# A personal website

Some people still want to have a personal website despite the possibilities of LinkedIn, Facebook and other sites that let you put stuff into the internets, obviously I am one of them. You can find the online version here: [knutjackowski.de](http://knutjackowski.de/)

While this started out as an assignment from [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com/) that was basically a one page portfolio site, I since then switched to a more classic kind of website, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a generator for the static HTML pages.

You can still find the [original portfolio assignment on Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/doxanthropos/pen/OVYjmX).
